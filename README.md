Vastlands

A realistic world generation mod for Minecraft 1.21.8, powered by NeoForge.

Planned Features

- Massive mountain ranges and natural valleys
- Realistic rivers, tributaries and waterfalls
- Expanded world height from Y=-256 to Y=511
- Vast cave systems with diverse formations
- Expansive forests and giant trees
- Natural terrain without floating islands

Status: Early development. The "Vastlands" world type and the Y=-256..511 world height work;
terrain, rivers, caves and forests are not implemented yet (the terrain is still vanilla-shaped).
See PROGRESS.md.

Using it

- Singleplayer: Create New World → World → World Type: Vastlands.
- Dedicated server: `level-type=vastlands\:vastlands` in `server.properties` before the world is created.
- The default world types are not changed by the mod.

Building

Requires Java 21. `./gradlew build` produces `build/libs/vastlands-<version>.jar` and runs the tests.
`./gradlew runClient` and `./gradlew runServer` start development instances in `run/`.
